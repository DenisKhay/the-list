## The List

*Money management app, or as i can it to name.. Whatever*

It is the root repo where I should accumulate my knowledges for to create app what will help me to manage my money. I don't want to use some one of hundreds (thousands?) already created and published around the markets. I am hungry to create one.

So there are a long long, or not so
#### Road map

1. of all define technology stack.
    More ore less - it is done.  
    I want to create it with  
    - Nodejs
    - Express
    - GraphQL
    - MongoDB
    - Auth0
    - Apollo
    - React
    - Socket.io
    - Docker
    - Capacitor  
   
    Evidently not all of the things will be bound together at once.
    It will be step by step process. Some positions can be added/wiped out during moving along.
    
2. A big leap - I should imagine how server side should work, in general at least.  
And it is done too, not all though, most of it. More details here - https://github.com/DenisKhay/gql-apollo-temp - it is actually draft for server side of the project. 

3. Small steps from here. Create frontend part. (Yet - just web, further it should be PWA/Hybrid app) Blank, only concepts. Should be represented as 
Standart react-create-app blank extended with CSS Modules on Sass + Apollo Client <<<<<<< Current state.  
4. Add durable (more or less) server for support blank web app. Server here - just only to bring life for react app. Api will be hosted in separate place.
5. Containerize web app.
